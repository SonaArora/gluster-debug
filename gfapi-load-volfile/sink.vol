# The template xlator does not do any memory allocations. It only passes the
# FOPs through to the next xlator.
#
# For testing, there is no next xlator needed, we are only interested in the
# resource usage of the Gluster core when gfapi is used.
#
# Note: The template xlator does not handle any calls. Mounting with just this
# xlator is not possible, there are some patches needed to allow the xlator
# work as a sink similar to the POSIX xlator or protocol/client.

# It is possible to test the resource usage of other xlators by adding them in
# the graph before the "sink".
